<h1>Clicked on Advertisement-</h1>
<br>
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set using Logistic regression algorithm, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
<br><br>
This data set contains the following features:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
<li>'Age': customer age in years
<li>'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
<li>'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
<li>'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement

<li>'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
<li>'Country': Country of consumer
<li>'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
